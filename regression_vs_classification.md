## Regression vs Classification ##

When the target variable that weâ€™re trying to predict is continuous, such as in the Houses Prices problem, we call the learning problem a regression problem. A regression problem is a problem where we are trying to predict a real-valued output. A regression problem can be defined as 'predicting a continuous output variable from a given set of input variables.'

When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem.

Why is it that Logistic Regression, which outputs discrete values, considered a regression algorithm?
