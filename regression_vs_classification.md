## Regression vs Classification ##

When the target variable that weâ€™re trying to predict is continuous, such as in the Houses Prices problem, we call the learning problem a regression problem. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem.

Why is it that Logistic Regression, which outputs discrete values, considered a regression algorithm?
