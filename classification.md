## Classification Algorithms ##

Any classification learning algorithm that builds a model implicitly or explicitly creates a decision boundary. The decision boundary can be straight, or curved, or it can have a complex form, or it can be a superposition of some geometrical figures. The form of the decision boundary determines the accuracy of the model (that is the ratio of examples whose labels are predicted correctly). The form of the decision boundary, the way it is algorithmically or mathematically computed based on the training data, differentiates one learning algorithm from another.

In practice, there are two other essential differentiators of learning algorithms to consider: speed of model building and prediction processing time. In many practical cases, you would prefer a learning algorithm that builds a less accurate model quickly. Additionally, you might prefer a less accurate model that is much quicker at making predictions.
