## Data Structures ##
A scalar is a simple numerical value, like 15 or âˆ’3.25. Variables or constants that take scalar values are denoted by an italic letter, like *x* or *a*. 

A vector is an ordered list of scalar values, called attributes. We denote a vector as a bold character, for example, **x** or **w**. Vectors can be visualized as arrows that point to some directions as well as points in a multi-dimensional space.
