## Machines don't learn ##
What a typical “learning machine” does, is finding a mathematical formula, which, when applied to a collection of inputs (called “training data”), produces the desired outputs. This mathematical formula also generates the correct outputs for most other inputs (distinct from the training data) on the condition that those inputs come from the same or a similar statistical distribution as the one the training data was drawn from.

So why the name “machine learning” then? The reason, as is often the case, is marketing:
Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence,
coined the term in 1959 while at IBM. Similar to how in the 2010s IBM tried to market
the term “cognitive computing” to stand out from competition, in the 1960s, IBM used the
new cool term “machine learning” to attract both clients and talented employees.

Machine learning is a universally recognized term that usually refers
to the science and engineering of building machines capable of doing various useful things
without being explicitly programmed to do so.

So essentially:
- we take some data to train the Machine Learning model
- the model learns patterns from this data
- classifies new data it has not seen before
